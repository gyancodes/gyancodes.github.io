        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        
        <p>Gyan Prakash Tiwari</p>
        <p>CS Graduate, 2024</p>
        <p>Backend Engineer</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Early-stage backend engineer building strong fundamentals through hands-on projects 
            and real-world learning. Started as a self-taught developer, explored multiple ideas, 
            shipped imperfect products, and learned what breaks in practice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My journey includes founding a university tech community, attempting a startup (which 
            failed), and working as a founding engineer at early-stage companies. These experiences 
            shaped my product thinking, comfort with ambiguity, and ability to learn fast. While 
            much of my early work involved rapid prototyping, I'm now deliberately slowing down to 
            focus on clean architecture, core backend concepts, and production-ready systems.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What I'm Working On (Next 2 Months):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Building backend applications with Node.js, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs</li>
            <li>Strengthening system fundamentals: data modeling, caching, basic scalability patterns</li>
            <li>Implementing authentication, authorization, and secure API practices</li>
            <li>Learning Docker and cloud basics to deploy and operate services end-to-end</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Master PostgreSQL fundamentals: indexes, query optimization, transactions</li>
            <li>Build 2-3 backend projects with clean architecture and proper testing</li>
            <li>Contribute to open source to learn from experienced engineers</li>
            <li>Study common design patterns and when to apply them</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Looking for a backend engineering role where I can grow under experienced engineers, 
            contribute incrementally, and build deep expertise in backend development, DevOps, 
            and cloud infrastructure.
